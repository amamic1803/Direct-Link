# Direct-Link

**UPDATE:** Doesn't work anymore (Google and Microsoft changed something). It appears to be impossible to get a direct download link anymore. I'm archiving this repository.

Generate direct download link for Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive

Paste a public link to any Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive file and get a link that automatically starts downloading when entered (without opening any webpage or asking for confirmation).
